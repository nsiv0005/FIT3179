        <h4>Trends in migration in and out of Australia</h4>
        <p>This graph illustrates the changes and population sizes of migrants coming into 
          and leaving Australia. Although the graph shows significant range from over 1,000,000
          to -15,000, the top few countries make up the bulk of Australian migration with the UK
          consistantly having over 1,000,000 migrants, and both India and China having increasing 
          populations up to 1,000,000. The ultimate trend is a consistant rise in migration to 
          Austrlia.

        <h4>Most popular Australian Migrant Locations</h4>
        <p>This dataset reflects migrant resident locations in Australia
          for 2022 and 2023. Regions like Melbourne City and Sydney Inner City see the 
          highest levels of net overseas migration which as much as 25,000 people residing 
          there compared to the average location migrant population of 2,693, suggesting 
          they are major hubs for international arrivals. The wide variability indicates 
          that while some areas attract large numbers of migrants, others see much lower
          migration, which may be influenced by factors such as job opportunities, 
          urbanization, and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The data reveals trends in the composition of Australia's population, comparing 
            Australian-born and overseas-born individuals across different age groups. 
            Younger age groups, particularly those under 24, have a significantly higher 
            proportion of Australian-born individuals, while the percentage of overseas-born 
            individuals increases in the older age groups. This suggests that immigration to 
            Australia is more prevalent among adults aged 24-45, potentially reflecting patterns 
            where immigrants move to Australia for work, family or higher educational reasons. 
            The growing proportion of overseas-born individuals in the working-age groups also 
            indicates that Australia remains an attractive destination for skilled workers and 
            professionals.</p>

          <p>The estimated resident population data by country of birth shows significant 
            growth between 2013 and 2023. In 2013, the highest population was from England with
            1,012,780, while by 2023, this number had decreased to 961,570. Countries like India 
            saw substantial growth, rising from 378,480 in 2013 to 845,800 in 2023. On average, 
            the populations increased over time, with the mean value rising from 399,130 in 2018 to 
            445,530 in 2023, indicating Australia's continued attraction as a destination for migrants 
            from diverse backgrounds.</p>

        <h2>Graph 5</h2>
        <p>The dataset below shows migration to and from Australia as well as net Australian 
          migration. It indicates that up until mid-2019, net Migration was consistantly up 
          so more people were constantly flowing into Australia reaching a max of 618,360 
          migrant arrivals. In 2020 however, this took a massive dip with migrant arrivals 
          dropping to 113,000 as well as migrant depatures dropping which resulted in a net 
          negative migration to -94,340. This shows the effect that COVID had on Australian 
          migration which halted migrant arrivals. However in the consequent years we can see
          a sharp increase in migrant arrivals which has again boosted net migration indicating
          global population shifts post COVID.
